# CORE VERTICAL — Cultural Heritage & Preservation Systems

This repository defines the Cultural Heritage vertical for CORE.

It is a **non-invasive preservation physics system** designed to analyze structures,
materials, and resonance behavior for conservation and long-term stability planning.

This vertical is explicitly curated to protect historical and cultural assets.

## Physics Stack (Authoritative)

This vertical composes:

- KINETIC — vibration, deformation, structural resonance
- ARES — acoustic propagation and amplification (non-invasive sensing)
- THERMOS — thermal expansion and gradient stress
- LITHOS — stone/material composition and damping profiles
- SIGNAL — anomaly detection, coherence, long-term drift
- RGSR — multi-domain fusion for preservation correlation

## Curated Real-World Phenomena

This vertical is curated to study:

- resonance amplification in monuments and structures
- micro-fracture and fatigue precursors (interpreted)
- thermal stress cycles across seasons
- material damping and structural stability
- vibration exposure (traffic, events, environment)

## What This Vertical Is

- A **preservation-grade analysis platform**
- A **structural and material monitoring interpretation system**
- A **non-destructive investigation toolkit**

## What This Vertical Is NOT

- Not a demolition planner
- Not an extraction system
- Not an engineering certification authority

## Registries & Lenses (Maintained Here)

- Structure archetype registry (bridges, monuments, cathedrals, etc.)
- Material library for heritage assets (stone, mortar, wood, metal)
- Non-invasive sensing presets
- Preservation reporting formats and templates

## Preservation Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

This vertical must prioritize:
- minimal intrusion
- non-invasive measurement
- conservative interpretation
- clear uncertainty labeling

## Governance

Bound by CORE governance and audit rules.
No operational control authority exists here.
